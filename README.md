## Liturgy of the Hours 

The Liturgy of the Hours (Latin: *Liturgia Horarum*) or Divine Office (*Officium Divinum*) or Work of God (*Opus Dei*) or canonical hours, often referred to as the **Breviary**, is the official set of prayers "marking the hours of each day and sanctifying the day with prayer".

It consists primarily of:

1. psalms 
2. supplemented by hymns, 
3. readings 
4. other prayers and antiphons. 

Together with the Mass, it constitutes the **official public prayer life** of the Church. The Liturgy of the Hours also forms the **basis of prayer within Christian monasticism**.
